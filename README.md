## Build

To build for production,

```
mvn -P \!dev package
```

## Developing

To begin developing, start with a REPL.

```sh
mvn compile exec:java
```

Run `start` to prep and initiate the system.

```
enkan> /start
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.


When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and reset the server.

```
enkan> /reset
```

## Docker

You can build the docker image of the api server and the proxy server using by jib.

```
% cd bouncr-api-server
% mvn -P\!dev,postgresql,hazelcast compile jib:dockerBuild
```

```
% cd bouncr-proxy
% mvn -P\!dev,postgresql,hazelcast compile jib:dockerBuild
```

`docker-compose.yml` can run the api server and the proxy server with Hazelcast and Postgresql database.
